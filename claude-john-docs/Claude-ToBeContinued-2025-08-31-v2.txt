# Text Adventure Game Project - Continuation Notes
Date: 2025-08-31 (Session 2)

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Text-based adventure game in 1970s/1980s Zork style, Halloween themed: "An exciting game of Trick or Treating and Suspense!"
Browser-based, fully functional prototype with terminal-like interface.

## JOHN'S DEVELOPMENT APPROACH - CRITICAL
- Build in VERY SMALL increments with minor improvements
- Do NOT suggest or build new features until John specifies them or asks for advice
- When John said "far more incremental than that" - this is his key feedback
- John has minimal programming skills, prefers simple self-contained apps
- ALWAYS backup files when requested using naming convention: filename.extension.backup##

## BACKUP SYSTEM ESTABLISHED
- Convention: filename.extension.backup## (backup01, backup02, etc.)
- Store in /backup folder
- Current version: backup05 files created for all project files
- John will ask to "backup those files" - do this for any files being modified

## MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE COMPLETED TODAY
**STATUS Box Split into Two Independent Sections:**
- Old: Single STATUS box with nested divs
- New: Separate ASCIIART section (top) and STATUS section (bottom)
- Grid changed from 4 sections to 5 sections
- Each section has independent initialization and styling

## CURRENT PROJECT STATE
Fully functional text adventure game prototype with:
- Fixed 1280x720px layout (5 sections: HEADER, TEXT, ASCIIART, PROMPT, STATUS)
- Smart command processing with prefix matching and shortcuts
- Command history with intelligent filtering (no invalid commands, no duplicate stateless)
- Color-coded text system (yellow prompts, teal commands, green flavor, red errors)
- JSON-based data architecture (samplePlaythrough.json, commands.json)
- **NEW**: Separate ASCIIART section with 60×32 character grid system
- Scrollable text buffer with custom scrollbar (1 line per scroll)

## ASCIIART SECTION - NEW REQUIREMENTS
**Critical Design Requirements:**
- **Exact dimensions**: 60 characters wide × 32 rows tall
- **Grid system**: Character-addressable by (x, y) coordinates starting at 0,0
- **Default state**: Entire grid filled with space characters (appears empty)
- **Individual character replacement**: Ability to place/replace single characters
- **Animation ready**: Structure supports future fade-in/fade-out effects
- **Font**: 8px "Courier New" monospace, line-height: 1
- **Fixed height**: 280px (no scrolling)
- **Standard ASCII only**: No Unicode characters allowed

## CURRENT TECHNICAL STATE
**Layout Changes Made:**
- index.html: Split into separate `<div class="ascii-art">` and `<div class="status">` 
- CSS: Grid changed to `grid-template-rows: 120px 280px 1fr 40px`
- CSS: Separate styling for `.ascii-art` and `.status` classes
- JavaScript: Separate `initializeAsciiArt()` and `initializeStatusInfo()` functions

**Test Pattern Currently Active:**
- Test grid showing 60-character lines with dots and descriptive text
- Lines numbered 01-32 with pipe character at position 60
- Demonstrates exact grid dimensions and character positioning
- Example: 'X' placed at position 25,22 to show coordinate system

## KEY TECHNICAL DECISIONS MADE
- CSS Grid for layout with specific proportions
- Text buffer uses object structure: {text: "...", type: "prompt|command|flavor|error"}
- Command matching: exact → shortcuts → prefix (2+ chars) → ambiguous/unknown
- Single-letter shortcuts have priority: 's' always means 'south'
- Stateless commands (like 'help', 'look') don't duplicate in history
- Native scrolling (1 line per scroll in TEXT section)
- ASCIIART and STATUS sections initialize independently

## FILES STRUCTURE
- index.html - 5-section grid layout
- textGame.css - styling with separate ascii-art and status classes
- textGame.js - game engine with split initialization functions
- commands.json - command definitions with types and responses
- samplePlaythrough.json - demo content for testing
- asciiArt.json - ASCII art storage (contains haunted house data)
- specifications.md - updated technical documentation
- /backup folder - contains backup05 versions of all files

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
1. **Implement ASCII Art Grid System:**
   - Create 60×32 grid filled with spaces by default
   - Add coordinate system functions: getCharAt(x,y), setCharAt(x,y,char)
   - Load ASCII art from JSON and populate grid
   - Remove current test pattern

2. **JSON ASCII Art Loading:**
   - Implement proper loading from asciiArt.json
   - Handle multi-line ASCII art placement in grid
   - Add error handling for missing art files

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
- John prefers functional programming but not strict
- Minimal git skills - remind about backups frequently
- No feature suggestions unless asked
- Keep improvements very small and targeted
- Always confirm backup naming and location
- ASCIIART section must be exactly 60×32 characters for animation support
- Use only standard ASCII characters (no Unicode)

## CURRENT SESSION ACHIEVEMENTS
- Split STATUS box into independent ASCIIART and STATUS sections
- Implemented 60×32 character grid test pattern
- Verified 8px font sizing and 280px height requirements
- Updated specifications.md with new architecture
- Created backup05 files for all project files
- Confirmed grid-based approach for future animation features
