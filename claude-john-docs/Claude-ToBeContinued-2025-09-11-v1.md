# Text Adventure Game - Current State
## Date: September 11, 2025

## Project Overview
Text adventure game prototype with fully integrated advanced ASCII art system. The game has been updated to use a **950×720px layout** with 5 main sections: HEADER, TEXT, ASCIIART, PROMPT, and STATUS. The ASCII art system supports 60×32 character grids with character-level addressability, 8 animation effects, and text file loading.

## Recent Session Work (September 11, 2025)

### Layout Dimension Updates (COMPLETED)
- **✅ Container resize from 1280px to 950px wide** - Updated main container for more compact display
- **✅ Grid column adjustments** - Text panel: 607px, ASCII/Status: 313px (289px content as required)
- **✅ CSS updates completed** - Modified textGame.css with new grid-template-columns
- **✅ SVG diagram updated** - layout-diagram.svg reflects new 950×720px dimensions
- **✅ Maintained vertical spacing** - Total height remains 720px with all panels properly sized

### New Layout Specifications
The game now uses optimized dimensions while maintaining all functionality:
- **Container:** 950×720px (930px grid area after 10px padding)
- **Header:** 930px wide (906px content after borders/padding)  
- **Text panel:** 607px wide (583px content)
- **Prompt panel:** 607px wide (583px content)
- **ASCII Art:** 313px wide (289px content - exact requirement maintained)
- **Status:** 313px wide (289px content)

## NEXT MAJOR PRIORITY: Game Data Format System

### Current Challenge
The game currently has basic command processing and ASCII art display, but lacks a comprehensive data format for creating the actual game world. The layout is now optimized at 950×720px and ready for content development.

### Required Data Format Components

#### 1. **Rooms/Locations System**
```json
{
  "rooms": {
    "front_steps": {
      "name": "Front Steps of the Mansion",
      "description": "You stand before an imposing Victorian mansion...",
      "asciiArt": "CASTLE",
      "exits": {
        "north": "foyer",
        "south": "garden_path"
      },
      "items": ["carved_pumpkin", "old_key"],
      "npcs": ["ghost_butler"],
      "actions": ["knock", "ring_doorbell"],

      "description": "A translucent figure in formal attire",
      "asciiArt": "GHOST",
      "dialogue": {
        "greeting": "Welcome to Ravenshollow Manor...",
        "responses": {
          "hello": "Good evening, young trick-or-treater",

        }
      },
      "inventory": ["mansion_map"],
      "hostile": false,
      "canTalk": true

        "items": []
      },
      "effects": {
        "message": "You knock loudly on the heavy wooden door...",
        "triggerEvent": "door_knock_response",
        "changeRoom": null
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 5. **Events/Triggers System**
```json

  "events": {
    "door_knock_response": {
      "conditions": {
        "firstTime": true,
        "hasItem": null
      },

            "unlockExit": "north",
            "addItem": null,
            "asciiArt": "DOOR_OPENING"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 6. **Game State System**
```json
{
  "gameState": {
    "currentRoom": "front_steps",
    "inventory": [],
    "stats": {
      "tricksCollected": 0,

      "metButler": false,
      "hasLantern": false
    },
    "timeOfDay": "evening"
  }
}
```

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Data Format Design (CURRENT PRIORITY)
1. **Create master data schema** - Define the complete JSON structure for all game elements
2. **Design room connection system** - How rooms link together with exits/entrances
3. **Establish item interaction rules** - How items can be used, combined, and affect game state
4. **Define action/command resolution** - How player commands map to game effects
5. **Create event trigger system** - How game events are triggered and resolved

#### Phase 2: Game Engine Implementation
1. **Data loader system** - Functions to load and parse game data files
2. **Room navigation engine** - Handle movement between rooms and room state
3. **Inventory management** - Add/remove items, check requirements
4. **Action processor** - Parse player commands and execute appropriate actions
5. **Event handler** - Process triggered events and update game state
6. **Save/load system** - Persist game state between sessions

#### Phase 3: Content Creation
1. **Create Halloween-themed game world** - Design interconnected rooms and locations
2. **Populate with items and NPCs** - Add interactive elements throughout the world
3. **Implement puzzle/quest system** - Create meaningful challenges and objectives
4. **Add ASCII art integration** - Link appropriate art to rooms, items, and events

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Design master game data format** - Create comprehensive JSON schema
2. **Create sample game data files** - Build small test world to validate format
3. **Implement basic data loader** - Function to read and parse game data
4. **Test data format** - Ensure all game elements can be represented
5. **Integrate with existing ASCII art system** - Link art pieces to game elements

### Technical Integration Points

#### ASCII Art Integration
- Rooms can specify default ASCII art pieces
- Items can have associated ASCII art for examination
- Events can trigger ASCII art displays
- NPCs can have character art representations
- **Optimal display**: 289px content width ensures proper art rendering

#### Command System Integration
- Existing command.json system to be expanded
- New action system to handle complex interactions
- Integration with current text display and color system

#### UI Integration - Optimized Layout
- **STATUS section** (289px content): Show inventory, stats, room info
- **TEXT section** (583px content): Display room descriptions and action results
- **ASCIIART section** (289px content): Show contextual art based on current room/action
- **PROMPT section** (583px content): Command input interface

## Development Notes

### File Organization Strategy
- `data/rooms.json` - All room definitions
- `data/items.json` - All item definitions  
- `data/npcs.json` - All NPC definitions
- `data/actions.json` - All action definitions
- `data/events.json` - All event definitions
- `data/gameSettings.json` - Game configuration and initial state

### Code Architecture Considerations
- Modular data loading system
- Event-driven architecture for game state changes
- Clear separation between data and game logic
- Extensible system for adding new content
- Optimized for 950×720px display format

### Testing Strategy
- Create simple test world with 3-4 rooms
- Test all major interaction types (movement, items, NPCs, events)
- Validate ASCII art integration works correctly with new layout
- Ensure game state persistence functions properly

## Current Status Summary

**✅ COMPLETED:**
- ASCII art system fully integrated and working
- Test environment functional and validated
- Basic command processing system
- **Layout optimization to 950×720px**
- **Visual documentation updated (SVG diagram)**
- Core game UI layout and styling updated

**🚧 IN PROGRESS:**
- Game data format design (NEXT PRIORITY)

**📋 UPCOMING:**
- Game engine implementation
- Sample game world creation
- Content authoring system

The project has completed a significant layout optimization phase and is ready to move into the actual game design and implementation phase. The ASCII art system provides a solid visual foundation with optimal sizing, and now we need to create the data structures and engine that will bring the game world to life.

## Layout Optimization Summary

The recent session successfully updated the game from 1280×720px to 950×720px:
- **Width reduction**: More compact, better for smaller screens
- **Maintained functionality**: All existing features work perfectly
- **Preserved ASCII art requirements**: 289px content width maintained
- **Clean documentation**: Updated specs and visual diagrams
- **Ready for content**: Optimal layout for game development

This represents a major technical milestone with the game now having both a solid technical foundation and an optimized, well-documented layout ready for content creation.
