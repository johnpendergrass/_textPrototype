# Text Adventure Game - Current State
## Date: September 11, 2025 - Version 0.12.1

## Project Overview
Text adventure game prototype transitioning from prototype to data-driven architecture. The game maintains a 950Ã—720px layout with 5 main sections: HEADER, TEXT, ASCIIART, PROMPT, and STATUS. The ASCII art system is fully integrated with 60Ã—32 character grids, 8 animation effects, and text file loading.

## Version 0.12.1 Goals (CURRENT SESSION)

### Strategic Direction: Data-Driven Architecture
The primary focus for v0.12.1 is transforming the game from a prototype with hardcoded content into a flexible, game-agnostic engine that loads content from JSON data files.

### Four Main Goals

#### 1. **Eliminate Hardcoded Data**
- Remove all game-specific content from JavaScript files
- Extract story text, room descriptions, item properties, and command responses
- Make the core engine content-neutral

#### 2. **Create Modular JSON Data System**
Establish `/gamedata/` folder with structured data files:
- **`movement.json`** - Navigation system, room connections, exit definitions
- **`rooms.json`** - Room descriptions, properties, available actions
- **`items.json`** - Item definitions, interactions, properties
- **`actions.json`** - Player commands, responses, game effects
- **`character.json`** - NPCs, player stats, dialogue systems
- Additional files as features expand

#### 3. **Incremental Game Engine Development**
- Build evaluation/processing logic one feature at a time
- Test each feature thoroughly before adding the next
- Maintain working game state throughout development
- Focus on small, testable improvements

#### 4. **Generic ASCII Art System**
- Keep all art in `asciiart.txt` with generic, reusable pieces
- Design art to work across multiple games/scenarios
- Create naming conventions that support flexible association
- Link art to rooms, items, and actions through data files

## Current Technical Foundation

### Layout Specifications (COMPLETED)
- **Container:** 950Ã—720px optimized layout
- **Panel Distribution:** 
  - Header: 930pxÃ—96px content area
  - Text: 583pxÃ—526px content area  
  - ASCII Art: 289pxÃ—256px content area
  - Status: 289pxÃ—286px content area
  - Prompt: 583pxÃ—16px content area

### ASCII Art System (FULLY INTEGRATED âœ…)
- Text file loading with metadata parsing
- 8 animation effects with speed control
- Main trigger function: `displayAsciiArt(artName, effectName, speed)`
- Test environment fully functional
- Ready for data-driven integration

### Current File Structure
```
textAdventure/
â”œâ”€â”€ textGame.html          # Main game interface
â”œâ”€â”€ textGame.css           # 950Ã—720px layout styling  
â”œâ”€â”€ textGame.js            # Game engine (to be refactored)
â”œâ”€â”€ asciiArt.txt           # ASCII art library
â”œâ”€â”€ commands.json          # Basic command definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ samplePlaythrough.json # Demo content
â””â”€â”€ claude-john-docs/      # Project documentation
```

## Development Strategy for v0.12.1

### Phase 1: Architecture Setup (IMMEDIATE)
1. **Create `/gamedata/` folder structure**
2. **Design JSON schema** for each data file type
3. **Create minimal test data** to validate structure
4. **Implement data loader functions** in game engine

### Phase 2: Feature Migration (INCREMENTAL)
1. **Movement System** - Extract room navigation to movement.json
2. **Room Descriptions** - Move room data to rooms.json  
3. **Basic Commands** - Expand actions.json with game-specific commands
4. **Item System** - Create items.json with simple take/drop mechanics
5. **Character System** - Add character.json with basic NPCs

### Phase 3: Game Engine Enhancement
1. **Command Processor** - Enhance to use JSON action definitions
2. **State Manager** - Track game state changes from data interactions
3. **Event System** - Handle triggers and consequences
4. **Save/Load System** - Persist game state between sessions

### Phase 4: Content Integration
1. **ASCII Art Linking** - Connect art pieces to game elements through data
2. **Halloween Theme** - Create cohesive Halloween game content
3. **Puzzle System** - Add meaningful challenges and objectives
4. **Polish and Testing** - Comprehensive testing and refinement

## Target Architecture

### Game Engine (Content Agnostic)
- **HTML/CSS/JS files** contain no game-specific content
- **Data loading system** reads from `/gamedata/` folder
- **Processing logic** handles any properly formatted game data
- **UI system** displays content based on loaded data

### Game Data (Modular and Interchangeable)
- **JSON files** define all game content
- **Folder structure** allows multiple games
- **Schema validation** ensures data compatibility  
- **Easy content creation** for new games

### Example Target Structure
```
textAdventure/
â”œâ”€â”€ textGame.html              # Generic engine
â”œâ”€â”€ textGame.css               # Generic styling
â”œâ”€â”€ textGame.js                # Generic game logic
â”œâ”€â”€ asciiArt.txt               # Generic art library
â””â”€â”€ gamedata/
    â”œâ”€â”€ movement.json          # Navigation rules
    â”œâ”€â”€ rooms.json             # Room definitions
    â”œâ”€â”€ items.json             # Item properties
    â”œâ”€â”€ actions.json           # Command responses
    â””â”€â”€ character.json         # NPCs and stats
```

## Development Approach

### Incremental Implementation
- **One feature at a time** - Focus on single functionality
- **Test after each change** - Maintain working game state
- **Gradual migration** - Move from hardcoded to data-driven
- **Preserve functionality** - Don't break existing features

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit testing** for data loading functions
- **Integration testing** for game engine components
- **Playthrough testing** after each feature addition
- **Regression testing** to ensure no functionality loss

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Update specifications.MD** with data-driven architecture details
2. **Create `/gamedata/` folder** and initial JSON files
3. **Design JSON schemas** for each data file type
4. **Implement basic data loader** in textGame.js
5. **Test data loading** with minimal content
6. **Begin movement system migration** as first feature

## Success Criteria

### Technical Goals
- âœ… Game engine loads content from JSON files
- âœ… No hardcoded game content in JavaScript
- âœ… ASCII art system integrates with data-driven content
- âœ… Multiple games can use same engine

### Functional Goals  
- âœ… All existing game functionality preserved
- âœ… Easy content creation and modification
- âœ… Extensible system for adding new features
- âœ… Clean separation between engine and content
