# Text Adventure Game - Current State
## Date: September 9, 2025

## Project Overview
Text adventure game prototype with fully integrated advanced ASCII art system. The game uses a 1280x720px layout with 5 main sections: HEADER, TEXT, ASCIIART, PROMPT, and STATUS. The ASCII art system supports 60Ã—32 character grids with character-level addressability, 8 animation effects, and text file loading.

## Recent Session Work (September 9, 2025)

### ASCII Art Test Environment Fixes (COMPLETED)
- **âœ… Fixed testASCII file paths** - Corrected broken file references in asciiArt folder
- **âœ… Restored working versions** - Used git restore to get original working testASCII files
- **âœ… File loading functionality** - testASCII app now properly loads files and populates art dropdown
- **âœ… asciiArt-castle format fix** - Updated castle file to proper text format with metadata headers

### Test Environment Status
The testASCII application in the `asciiArt/` folder is now fully functional:
- File dropdown works with known files (asciiArt.txt, asciiArt-castle 48x30.txt)
- ASCII ART PIECES dropdown populates correctly when files are loaded
- All 8 animation effects work properly
- Validation system shows file format compliance

## Current File Structure

## NEXT MAJOR PRIORITY: Game Data Format System

### Current Challenge
The game currently has basic command processing and ASCII art display, but lacks a comprehensive data format for creating the actual game world. We need to design and implement a general data system that defines:

### Required Data Format Components

#### 1. **Rooms/Locations System**
```json
{
  "rooms": {
    "front_steps": {
      "name": "Front Steps of the Mansion",
      "description": "You stand before an imposing Victorian mansion...",
      "asciiArt": "CASTLE",
      "exits": {
        "north": "foyer",
        "south": "garden_path"
      },
      "items": ["carved_pumpkin", "old_key"],
      "npcs": ["ghost_butler"],
      "actions": ["knock", "ring_doorbell"],

            "unlockExit": "north",
            "addItem": null,
            "asciiArt": "DOOR_OPENING"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 6. **Game State System**

  }
}
```

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Data Format Design (CURRENT PRIORITY)
1. **Create master data schema** - Define the complete JSON structure for all game elements
2. **Design room connection system** - How rooms link together with exits/entrances
3. **Establish item interaction rules** - How items can be used, combined, and affect game state
4. **Define action/command resolution** - How player commands map to game effects
5. **Create event trigger system** - How game events are triggered and resolved

#### Phase 2: Game Engine Implementation
1. **Data loader system** - Functions to load and parse game data files
2. **Room navigation engine** - Handle movement between rooms and room state
3. **Inventory management** - Add/remove items, check requirements
4. **Action processor** - Parse player commands and execute appropriate actions
5. **Event handler** - Process triggered events and update game state
6. **Save/load system** - Persist game state between sessions

#### Phase 3: Content Creation
1. **Create Halloween-themed game world** - Design interconnected rooms and locations
2. **Populate with items and NPCs** - Add interactive elements throughout the world
3. **Implement puzzle/quest system** - Create meaningful challenges and objectives
4. **Add ASCII art integration** - Link appropriate art to rooms, items, and events

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Design master game data format** - Create comprehensive JSON schema
2. **Create sample game data files** - Build small test world to validate format
3. **Implement basic data loader** - Function to read and parse game data
4. **Test data format** - Ensure all game elements can be represented
5. **Integrate with existing ASCII art system** - Link art pieces to game elements

### Technical Integration Points

#### ASCII Art Integration
- Rooms can specify default ASCII art pieces
- Items can have associated ASCII art for examination
- Events can trigger ASCII art displays
- NPCs can have character art representations

#### Command System Integration
- Existing command.json system to be expanded
- New action system to handle complex interactions
- Integration with current text display and color system

#### UI Integration
- STATUS section to show inventory, stats, room info
- TEXT section to display room descriptions and action results
- ASCIIART section to show contextual art based on current room/action

## Development Notes

### File Organization Strategy
- `data/rooms.json` - All room definitions
- `data/items.json` - All item definitions  
- `data/npcs.json` - All NPC definitions
- `data/actions.json` - All action definitions
- `data/events.json` - All event definitions
- `data/gameSettings.json` - Game configuration and initial state

### Code Architecture Considerations
- Modular data loading system
- Event-driven architecture for game state changes
- Clear separation between data and game logic
- Extensible system for adding new content

### Testing Strategy
- Create simple test world with 3-4 rooms
- Test all major interaction types (movement, items, NPCs, events)
- Validate ASCII art integration works correctly
- Ensure game state persistence functions properly

## Current Status Summary

**âœ… COMPLETED:**
- ASCII art system fully integrated and working
- Test environment functional and validated
- Basic command processing system
- Core game UI layout and styling

**ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS:**
- Game data format design (NEXT PRIORITY)

**ðŸ“‹ UPCOMING:**
- Game engine implementation
- Sample game world creation
- Content authoring system

The project is ready to move from the technical foundation phase into the actual game design and implementation phase. The ASCII art system provides a solid visual foundation, and now we need to create the data structures and engine that will bring the game world to life.
