# Text Adventure Game Project - Continuation Notes
Date: 2025-09-01

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Text-based adventure game in 1970s/1980s Zork style, Halloween themed: "An exciting game of Trick or Treating and Suspense!"
Browser-based, fully functional prototype with terminal-like interface.

## JOHN'S DEVELOPMENT APPROACH - CRITICAL
- Build in VERY SMALL increments with minor improvements
- Do NOT suggest or build new features until John specifies them or asks for advice
- When John said "far more incremental than that" - this is his key feedback
- John has minimal programming skills, prefers simple self-contained apps
- ALWAYS backup files when requested using naming convention: filename.extension.backup##

## BACKUP SYSTEM ESTABLISHED
- Convention: filename.extension.backup## (backup01, backup02, etc.)
- Store in /backup folder
- Current version: backup07 files created for all project files
- John will ask to "backup those files" - do this for any files being modified

## MAJOR RECENT ACHIEVEMENT - ASCII ART GRID SYSTEM
**Implemented Character-Level ASCII Art Display System:**
- Complete 60×32 character grid with individual character addressability
- 2D JavaScript array system for memory buffer management  
- Character-by-character animation effects with batched DOM updates
- Fade-in effect with customizable timing (currently 3 chars per batch, 2ms delay)
- Testing hotkeys: 'B' for blank screen, 'C' for castle fade-in

## CURRENT PROJECT STATE
Fully functional text adventure game prototype with:
- Fixed 1280x720px layout (5 sections: HEADER, TEXT, ASCIIART, PROMPT, STATUS)
- Smart command processing with prefix matching and shortcuts
- Command history with intelligent filtering (no invalid commands, no duplicate stateless)
- Color-coded text system (yellow prompts, teal commands, green flavor, red errors)
- JSON-based data architecture (samplePlaythrough.json, commands.json, asciiArt.json)
- **NEW**: Advanced ASCII art system with character-level control and animation effects
- Scrollable text buffer with custom scrollbar (1 line per scroll)

## ASCII ART SYSTEM - CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION
**Grid Architecture:**
- Display grid: 32×60 2D JavaScript array (displayGrid)
- Source data: JSON format with arrays of 60-character strings
- Conversion pipeline: JSON strings → 2D array → DOM display
- Character-addressable: displayGrid[y][x] for individual character access

**Animation System:**
- Fade-in effect: Characters appear character-by-character in batches
- Performance optimized: 3 characters per DOM update (not 1920 individual updates)
- Customizable timing: Currently 2ms delay between batch updates
- Sleep function for animation delays: sleep(ms) returns Promise

**Current ASCII Art Library:**
- DEFAULT: 32×60 grid filled with spaces (blank screen)
- CASTLE: Detailed castle artwork centered in grid
- SAMPLE: Test pattern with grid markers and positioning info

**Testing Interface:**
- 'B' hotkey: Load blank/DEFAULT screen instantly
- 'C' hotkey: Load castle with fade-in animation effect
- Works from anywhere on page (global key listener)

## KEY TECHNICAL DECISIONS MADE
- CSS Grid for layout with specific proportions
- Text buffer uses object structure: {text: "...", type: "prompt|command|flavor|error"}
- Command matching: exact → shortcuts → prefix (2+ chars) → ambiguous/unknown
- Single-letter shortcuts have priority: 's' always means 'south'
- Stateless commands (like 'help', 'look') don't duplicate in history
- Native scrolling (1 line per scroll in TEXT section)
- ASCII art uses character-by-character manipulation for maximum flexibility

## FILES STRUCTURE
- index.html - 5-section grid layout
- textGame.css - styling with organized section headers
- textGame.js - game engine with ASCII art grid system
- commands.json - command definitions with types and responses
- samplePlaythrough.json - demo content for testing
- asciiArt.json - ASCII art storage with DEFAULT, CASTLE, SAMPLE
- specifications.md - comprehensive technical documentation
- /backup folder - contains backup07 versions of all files

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### 1. **ASCII Art JSON Loader System:**
- Replace hardcoded castleLines array with JSON loader
- Create loadAsciiArtLibrary() function to read asciiArt.json
- Create AsciiArtBuffer class for managing loaded art pieces
- Test loading and displaying DEFAULT and CASTLE from JSON

### 2. **Animation System Enhancements:**
- Experiment with different loading effects:
  - Random character placement (scattered fill)
  - Row-by-row loading (typewriter style)
  - Column-by-column effects
  - Different timing speeds (instant, slow, fast)
- Add more transition effects between images
- Consider fade-out animations when switching art

### 3. **System Refinements:**
- Fine-tune animation timing based on visual feedback
- Add error handling for missing ASCII art files
- Consider adding more test art pieces to asciiArt.json
- Optimize performance if needed

### 4. **Testing and Polish:**
- Test JSON loading thoroughly
- Verify all animation effects work smoothly  
- Add more hotkeys for different effects if desired
- Ensure system is ready for game integration

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
- John prefers functional programming but not strict
- Minimal git skills - remind about backups frequently
- No feature suggestions unless asked
- Keep improvements very small and targeted
- Always confirm backup naming and location
- ASCII art system must maintain 60×32 character grid for consistency
- Use only standard ASCII characters (no Unicode)

## CURRENT SESSION ACHIEVEMENTS
- Implemented complete ASCII art grid system with 2D array architecture
- Added character-by-character animation with batched DOM updates  
- Created fade-in effect with customizable timing
- Added testing hotkeys ('B' for blank, 'C' for castle fade-in)
- Updated specifications.md with comprehensive ASCII art documentation
- Created backup07 files for all project files
- Established foundation for JSON-based art loading system

## TECHNICAL NOTES
- Display grid uses Array(32).fill().map(() => Array(60).fill(' ')) structure
- Batch updates every 3 characters for optimal performance
- Sleep function: `function sleep(ms) { return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms)); }`
- Animation can be customized by adjusting CHARS_PER_UPDATE and delay parameters
- System ready for expansion to multiple art pieces and effect types
